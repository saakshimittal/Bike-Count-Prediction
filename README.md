# Bike-Count-Prediction
Bike Renting Systems are the latest trend that are introduced into the market lately 
replacing the old way renting bikes. These systems made it easy for a customer to rent 
a bike within seconds and ease the services where pick up and dropping them is very 
easy. These bike sharing systems are very useful as they accurately record the travel 
duration, arrival and departure positions when compared to other transport services 
which is done by using virtual sensor network using which we can sense the location of 
the vehicle anywhere in the city. In this project, based on certain attribute such as 
weather, specific hour and all the day information we predict the hourly bike count 
which is the main motto of this paper. Here it is a step by step process where we initially 
do the Descriptive Analysis, then based on it we do Missing Value Analysis, then we 
do Outlier Analysis, then Correlation Analysis, then the most important step where for 
the given data we do a Model Selection where in our case we get that the Random Forest 
Regression is the best for the given data set and scenario. Then finally we perform 
Random Forest Model and at last we plot a graph of Feature importance and conclude 
the necessary attributes.
